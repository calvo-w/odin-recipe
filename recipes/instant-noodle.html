        <img src="https://i.gzn.jp/img/2017/08/21/ippeichan-mega-shibire-pork/00.jpg" alt="The best instant noodles in the world, Ippei-Chan.">
        <p>When instant noodles are mentioned, the first thing that comes to mind is commonly the Nissin noodles that come in a styrofoam cup, the 25-cent Maruchan noodles, or maybe Shin ramen.
            But have you ever had dry instant noodles? The noodles are still softened with boiling water, then the water is poured out prior to consumption.
            This specific recipe calls for the greatest instant noodle of all time <strong>Ippei-Chan</strong>, and takes it a step further, by adding ingredients with nutritional value! This helps reduce the guilt of consuming junk food, while keeping these noodles "instant".

        <p>The combination of worcestershire sauce and mayonnaise give these noodle the perfect balance of flavors and a load of umami. 
            <a href="https://www.theramenrater.com/top-ten-lists/by-country/top-ten-japanese-instant-noodles-japan-2014/">The Ramen Rater</a> seems to agree with my assessment of these noodles. You can read his review for a more in depth description of what makes these noodles so wonderful.

        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One pack of Ippei-Chan</li>
            <li>One stalk of green onion</li>
            <li>One tsp. of sesame seeds</li>
            <li>One baby bok choy</li>
            <li>One egg (or two)</li>
            <li>One tsp. of cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil some water for Ippei-Chan.</li>
            <li>In the mean time, wash your green onion and peel and wash your baby bok choy.</li>
            <li>Finely cut your green onion.</li>
            <li>Open your Ippei-Chan package lid to the dotted line, and remove the sauce, seasoning, and mayonnaise packets.</li>
            <li>Once your water starts to boil, pour the water into the Ippei-Chan bowl up to the indent.</li>
            <li>Replace the lid so the bowl is fully covered. Use a pair of chopsticks or a fork to hold down the lid if necessary. Let the noodles cook for three minutes.</li>
            <li>Add your cooking oil to a small frying pan, and heat it on high</li>
            <li>When the pan is nice and hot, add your eggs.</li>
            <li>Flip the eggs once the bottom is brown and crispy, and remove from heat once the second side is also crispy.</li>
            <li>The noodles should be ready by now. Peel the drain spout sticker off, and pour the water into the sink.</li>
            <li>Add your sauce, seasoning, and mayonnaise packets to the noodles, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Now top your noodles with the fried egg, and sprinkle your green onion and sesame seeds on top.</li>
        </ol>
