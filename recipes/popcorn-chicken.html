    <h1>Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken Recipe</h1>

    <p>Finding authentic foreign recipes using English search terms is not easy. My personal experiences doing so have frequently resulted in missing spices, incorrect flavor balances, or absolute bastardization of the dishes. 
        This makes it very difficult to learn to cook those dishes the "right" way. Fortunately, this popcorn chicken recipe is not one of those miscreants. The original creator wrote the <a href="https://food.ltn.com.tw/article/1870" target="_blank" class="project-tile">recipe in Chinese</a>, 
        and I am merely translating it.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe has been very well received by my friends, with some likening it to popcorn chicken at tea shops we frequented in our adolescent years. 
        My only suggestion is to use more basil, it shrunk more than I had anticipated after deep frying, and I wished I had purchased more at the grocery store.

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lb Chicken Breast or Boneless Thigh</li>
        <li>1/2 bowl Potato Starch or Tapioca Starch</li>
        <li>A bunch of basil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Marinade</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp. Light Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. Salt or Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. Rice Wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. Five Spice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cube the chicken</li>
        <li>Mix all marinade ingredients except for the egg in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Toss the chicken in the marinade.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg over the chicken, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the chicken for at least one hour. A whole day is recommended!</li>
        <br>
        <p>After marinating</p>
        <li>Preheat a pot of oil</li>
        <li>Add the starch into a bowl and start coating the chicken.</li>
        <li>Let the coated chicken rest for a few minutes, before coating in starch a second time. When the starch coating starts looking darker and moist, you will know it is ready for the second coat. This second coat really brings out the flaky crunchy goodness that is commonly associated with this dish.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest again, waiting for the coating to darken and moisten. By letting the coating moisten, it clings to the chicken better, so that it does not fall off during the frying process.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken. I like to fry for about five minutes, before taking the chicken out to rest. I then fry the basil in the oil until it starts shriveling up. After removing the basil from the oil, I then fry the chicken a second time, for approximately 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl or wok, along with the basil. Season to taste with salt and ground white pepper. Toss mixture until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
